  abstract = {This paper presents our approach to participate in the SemEval 2017 Task 12: Clinical TempEval challenge, specifically in the event and time expressions span and attribute identification subtasks (ES, EA, TS, TA). Our approach consisted in training Conditional Random Fields (CRF) classifiers using the provided annotations, and in creating manually curated rules to classify the attributes of each event and time expression. We used a set of common features for the event and time CRF classifiers, and a set of features specific to each type of entity, based on domain knowledge. Training only on the source domain data, our best F-scores were 0.683 and 0.485 for event and time span identification subtasks. When adding target domain annotations to the training data, the best F-scores obtained were 0.729 and 0.554, for the same subtasks. We obtained the second highest F-score of the challenge on the event polarity subtask (0.708).

  abstract = {Recent studies have proposed deep learning techniques, namely recurrent neural networks, to improve biomedical text mining tasks. However, these techniques rarely take advantage of existing domain-specific resources, such as ontologies. In Life and Health Sciences there is a vast and valuable set of such resources publicly available, which are continuously being updated. Biomedical ontologies are nowadays a mainstream approach to formalize existing knowledge about entities, such as genes, chemicals, phenotypes, and disorders. These resources contain supplementary information that may not be yet encoded in training data, particularly in domains with limited labeled data. We propose a new model to detect and classify relations in text, BO-LSTM, that takes advantage of domain-specific ontologies, by representing each entity as the sequence of its ancestors in the ontology. We implemented BO-LSTM as a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units and using open biomedical ontologies, specifically Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI), Human Phenotype, and Gene Ontology. We assessed the performance of BO-LSTM with drug-drug interactions mentioned in a publicly available corpus from an international challenge, composed of 792 drug descriptions and 233 scientific abstracts. By using the domain-specific ontology in addition to word embeddings and WordNet, BO-LSTM improved the F1-score of both the detection and classification of drug-drug interactions, particularly in a document set with a limited number of annotations. We adapted an existing DDI extraction model with our ontology-based method, obtaining a higher F1 score than the original model. Furthermore, we developed and made available a corpus of 228 abstracts annotated with relations between genes and phenotypes, and demonstrated how BO-LSTM can be applied to other types of relations. Our findings demonstrate that besides the high performance of current deep learning techniques, domain-specific ontologies can still be useful to mitigate the lack of labeled data.},

This paper presents the Phenotype-Gene Relations (PGR) corpus, a silver standard corpus of human phenotype and gene annotations and their relations. The corpus consists of 1712 abstracts, 5676 human phenotype annotations, 13835 gene annotations, and 4283 relations. We generated this corpus using Named-Entity Recognition tools, whose results were partially evaluated by eight curators, obtaining a precision of 87.01%. By using the corpus we were able to obtain promising results with two state-of-the-art deep learning tools, namely 78.05% of precision. The PGR corpus was made publicly available to the research community.},

Most biomedical relation extraction systems do not resort to external sources of knowledge, such as domain-specific ontologies. However, using deep learning methods, along with biomedical ontologies, has been recently shown to effectively advance the biomedical relation extraction field. To perform relation extraction, our deep learning system, BiOnt, employs four types of biomedical ontologies, namely, the Gene Ontology, the Human Phenotype Ontology, the Human Disease Ontology, and the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, regarding gene-products, phenotypes, diseases, and chemical compounds, respectively. We tested our system with three data sets that represent three different types of relations of biomedical entities. BiOnt achieved, in F-score, an improvement of 4.93 percentage points for drug-drug interactions (DDI corpus), 4.99 percentage points for phenotype-gene relations (PGR corpus), and 2.21 percentage points for chemical-induced disease relations (BC5CDR corpus), relatively to the state-of-the-art.

Furthermore, datasets created using distant supervision techniques also have some false negative relations that constitute undocumented/unknown relations (missing from a knowledge base). We propose to improve the distinction between these concepts, by revising a subset of the relations marked as false on the phenotype-gene relations corpus and give the first steps to automatically distinguish between the false (F), negative (N), and unknown (U) results.

While some progress has been made in this area, biomedical questions are still a challenge to most QA approaches, due to the complexity of the domain and limited availability of training sets. We present a method to automatically extract question-article pairs from Q&A web forums, which can be used for document retrieval, a crucial step of most QA systems. The proposed framework extracts from selected forums the questions and the respective answers that contain citations. This way, QA systems based on document retrieval can be developed and evaluated using the question-article pairs annotated by users of these forums. We generated the BiQA corpus by applying our framework to three forums, obtaining 7,453 questions and 14,239 question-article pairs. We evaluated how the number of articles associated with each question and the number of votes on each answer affects the performance of baseline document retrieval approaches. Also, we demonstrated that the articles given as answers are significantly similar to the questions and trained a state-of-the-art deep learning model that obtained similar performance to using a dataset manually annotated by experts. The proposed framework can be used to update the BiQA corpus from the same forums as new posts are made, and from other forums that support their answers with documents.

This work aims to build a new semantic-based pipeline for recommending biomedical entities to scientific researchers. To this end, we developed a pipeline that creates an implicit feedback matrix based on Named Entity Recognition (NER) on a corpus of documents, using multidisciplinary ontologies for recognizing and linking the entities. Our hypothesis is that by using ontologies from different fields in the NER phase, we can improve the results for state-of-the-art collaborative-filtering recommender systems applied to the dataset created. The tests performed using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) dataset show that when using four ontologies, the results for precision@k, for example, reach the 80%, whereas when using only one ontology, the results for precision@k drops to 20%, for the same users. Furthermore, the use of multi-fields entities may help in the discovery of new items, even if the researchers do not have items from that field in their set of preferences.},

  abstract = {Biomedical relation extraction (RE) datasets are vital in the construction of knowledge bases and to potentiate the discovery of new interactions. There are several ways to create biomedical RE datasets, some more reliable than others, such as resorting to domain expert annotations. However, the emerging use of crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), can potentially reduce the cost of RE dataset construction, even if the same level of quality cannot be guaranteed. There is a lack of power of the researcher to control who, how and in what context workers engage in crowdsourcing platforms. Hence, allying distant supervision with crowdsourcing can be a more reliable alternative. The crowdsourcing workers would be asked only to rectify or discard already existing annotations, which would make the process less dependent on their ability to interpret complex biomedical sentences. In this work, we use a previously created distantly supervised human phenotype–gene relations (PGR) dataset to perform crowdsourcing validation. We divided the original dataset into two annotation tasks: Task 1, 70% of the dataset annotated by one worker, and Task 2, 30% of the dataset annotated by seven workers. Also, for Task 2, we added an extra rater on-site and a domain expert to further assess the crowdsourcing validation quality. Here, we describe a detailed pipeline for RE crowdsourcing validation, creating a new release of the PGR dataset with partial domain expert revision, and assess the quality of the MTurk platform. We applied the new dataset to two state-of-the-art deep learning systems (BiOnt and BioBERT) and compared its performance with the original PGR dataset, as well as combinations between the two, achieving a 0.3494 increase in average F-measure. The code supporting our work and the new release of the PGR dataset is available at https://github.com/lasigeBioTM/PGR-crowd.},

Most state-of-the-art systems use deep learning approaches, mainly to target relations between entities of the same type, such as proteins or pharmacological substances. However, these systems are mostly restricted to what they directly identify on the text and ignore specialized domain knowledge bases, such as ontologies, that formalize and integrate biomedical information typically structured as direct acyclic graphs. On the other hand, Knowledge Graph (KG)-based recommendation systems already showed the importance of integrating KGs to add additional features to items. Typical systems have users as people and items that can range from movies to books, which people saw or read and classified according to their satisfaction rate. This work proposes to integrate KGs into biomedical RE through a recommendation model to further improve their range of action. We developed a new RE system, named K-BiOnt, by integrating a baseline state-of-the-art deep biomedical RE system with an existing KG-based recommendation state-of-the-art system. Our results show that adding recommendations from KG-based recommendation improves the system’s ability to identify true relations that the baseline deep RE model could not extract from the text.

RE is a text mining task for which the state-of-the-art approaches use bidirectional encoders, namely, BERT. However, state-of-the-art performance may be limited by the lack of efficient external knowledge injection approaches, with a larger impact in the biomedical area given the widespread usage and high quality of biomedical ontologies. This knowledge can propel these systems forward by aiding them in predicting more explainable biomedical associations. With this in mind, we developed K-RET, a novel, knowledgeable biomedical RE system that, for the first time, injects knowledge by handling different types of associations, multiple sources and where to apply it, and multi-token entities. We tested K-RET on three independent and open-access corpora (DDI, BC5CDR, and PGR) using four biomedical ontologies handling different entities. K-RET improved state-of-the-art results by 2.68% on average, with the DDI Corpus yielding the most significant boost in performance, from 79.30% to 87.19% in F-measure, representing a P-value of 2.91E-12⁠.},

  abstract = {Biomedical relation extraction is a crucial task for extracting valuable knowledge from unstructured scientific literature. This paper discusses our team's, lasigeBioTM, involvement in the BioCreative VIII Track 1: BioRED in both sub-tasks. Our primary focus was on the relation extraction (RE) task, taking advantage of the K-RET system in combination with Gene Ontology, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, Human Phenotype Ontology, Human Disease Ontology and NCBITaxon Ontology. The objective was to evaluate whether the use of external knowledge could enhance the performance of the relation extraction task, both for entity relationships and for detecting novel information. Our results in both tasks were below the average and we were not able to discern the impact of the introduced external knowledge. However, it was observed that for our model, a cleaner dataset is needed for improved performance and the necessity for a larger number of example instances, as our model struggled to identify low-represented labels.},

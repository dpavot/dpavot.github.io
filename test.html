<p>Hi there, I’m Aaditya (Ankit), a Senior Research Engineer specializing in NLP, Deep learning, and Machine learning. My research aims to develop machine learning methods in the Healthcare domain.</p>

<p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.saama.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Saama</a>, conducting research to accelerate <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/articles/how_a_novel_incubation_sandbox_helped_speed_up_data_analysis_in_pfizer_s_covid_19_vaccine_trial" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">clinical trials and reduce drug development timelines</a>. Before joining Saama, I worked as an NLP and Backend Engineer at <a href="https://prescienceds.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prescience</a>. My research interests involve Representation Learning on Graphs, Federated learning, XAI, Generative language models and their applications in Healthcare data.</p>

<p>I’ve been honored to contribute meaningful research and datasets that have been adopted by leading companies like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09085" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Facebook AI</a> (Galactica), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09617" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google AI</a> (Med-PaLM, Med-PaLM-2), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13375" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft, and OpenAI</a> (GPT-4) to further responsible advancements in AI.</p>

<p>I have a deep appreciation for open-source work and contribute to projects including Tensorflow, Pytorch Geometric and HuggingFace. In December 2022, I noticed structured output issues in large language models and developed <a href="https://github.com/promptslab/Promptify" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Promptify</a>, which received encouraging feedback on GitHub and assisted relief efforts during the <a href="https://dev.to/erayg/how-an-open-source-disaster-map-helped-thousands-of-earthquake-survivors-afetharitacom-440" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Turkey-Syria earthquake</a>. During COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, I initiated a project to capture cough and breath sounds via phone to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02417" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">classify COVID-19 coughs using deep learning</a>, with the aim of aiding doctors in rapid pre-screening of patients.</p>

<p>If you are still reading, here is more about me: Apart from my research life, I’m drawn to activities like Boxing, Jiu-Jitsu and Chess. I enjoy spending time in nature, Observation, and Philosophy. I have realized to some extent that everything is connected; there is neither good nor bad; there is neither positive nor negative. I often displace myself away from social noise, take a seat, and try to see, observe, rather than just looking at it. In the process, I naturally learn.</p>

<!-- I was also privileged to serve as a reviewer for journals [Springer Nature 2021](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AAA-9381-2021), [IEEE Access 2021](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AAA-9381-2021) and [IEEE Access 2022](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AAA-9381-2021). -->

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
